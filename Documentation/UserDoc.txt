down button.
  
  Celsius - The current temperature, average, high, and low temperatures are
    displayed in Celsius.
    
  Fahrenheit - The current temperature, average, high, and low temperatures are
    displayed in Fahrenheit.
    
  Morse Code - In this mode pressing the select button sends a "dot" to the arduino
    RGB light. Long pressing the select button sends a "dash".
    
  Time - While in this mode the time is displayed on the arduino 7 segment display.
  
  Graph - In this mode a graph of the relative differences in the hourly temperatures
    for up to the past 5 hours is displayed
    
In addition pressing the up button in any mode sets the arduino into standby mode 
where it stops reporting the temperature and displays all zeros. Pressing the select
button in any mode except Morse Code mode refreshes the display. Pressing back at
any point will leave the application.
